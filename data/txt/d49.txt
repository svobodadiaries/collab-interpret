        [Notes on the diary transcriptions:
     
        In many of the diaries there are marginal notes in Arabic
        written in ink by the Baghdad historian Yaqub Serkis sometime
        after he received them from Alexander Svoboda probably
        in the late 1920s.  Because these notes are a later
        addition extrinsic to Joseph Mathia Svoboda's writings,
        we have gathered them in an appendix where they are listed
        under unique identifiers--for example [A47_006_09:001]--recording
        the diary number, place in the diary, and numerical order.
        In this edition of the diaries, these identifiers are not
        linked directly to the notes in the appendix.
     
     
        For some of the diaries, we have prepared minimal notes and
        glosses as well as extensive word lists.
        These are available from our website.
     
     
        Images of the original diaries' content are archived
        on the University of Washington Libraries
        content management system ContentDM.  See:
        
     
        http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/cdm/search/collection/ir\
aqdiaries
        
        
        For many of the diary transcription we have provided
        live links to the original diary pages
        invoked by clicking on the page numbers in our
        HTML display.  Where links are not provided,
        one may refer to the original diary images in ContentDM.
        
        
        In several of the diaries, pockets in the back covers
        hold a variety of memorabilia including
        newspaper clippings, pictures, and souvenirs.  Some
        of the textual material has been transcribed and
        is visible in the HTML display.  This was not done consistently
        but the contents of the pockets are displayed in the images
        in ContentDM.]

            of Beyrout dated the 6 Feby
            
            in which he says that the
            
            Consul General of Austria
            
            of Paris writes that after

            gone to England

            about 2 months ago;
            
            she has brought a complaint
            
            a few days ago against
            
            Artin for having violated

            Effendi the Lawyer sent

            my visit to Ahmed Beg
            
            is not required, so they

            land them; also to Allow
            
            the Khoory Toma Bahi
            
            to let him land with her

            Assyrian Bishop Aghnatius
            
            off, as this latter is going

            leave for business & the
            
            Khoory Toma is acting for
            
            him; But this morning
            
            when Capt Cowley came on

            Coot passage, & even
            
            that he objected, so he
            
            went back on shore,
            
            I am awfully sorry, for
            
            it, as my wife had invited
            
            him to stay & breakfast
            
            with her; I am so very
            
            sorry & disappointed at
