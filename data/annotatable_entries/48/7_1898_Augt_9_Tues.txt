9' Tuesd Ther@4.88 1898 Augt 1898 Augt Modte N.W. & clouds gathering around & above from the north & west, At 6 ½ am called on Sister Medula & then came on board, we are discharging cargo
 Warm & cloudy
 At 9 am as I had left to go to D Rosen the German Consul, I met his Kawass with a letter for me asking me to go & see him, so I went, we spoke over the matter of Alexander and the letter he had written to the German Ambassadore in Paris, and as I saw that it only contains the prevention of his getting married, and this he cannot do it firstly because he has not yet attained 25 years as the rule is in France Austria etc, & 2d he cannot do it without my consent, it is useless writing about it since he cannot be married, so he wrote a letter to Julietti asking him to withdraw the letter & telegraph to Beyrout to return it & I will then pay the expences
 D. Rosen told that we better wait until his letters arrive and the best thing I can do is to stop his supplies of money and he will then come to his sense
 ~ I left and called on Capt & Mrs Cowley & we also talked about this matter
 I then left and called on Monseigneur Altmayer he has not yet received the answer from Cardinal Richard & we spoke over the matter I also called on Alice & Sister Emilia for ½ hours and then went to Lynch office & saw Mr. Bottomley & I related the case of my son to him as he wished to know
 he regrets the matter very much and he is of the opinion that if I stop the money he will be obliged to renounce & regret what he has done, I came home at noon Weather very hot and disagreable ~ At 3 P.M. I came on board We are taking cargo ~ At 5 I went home, Menusha & Sister Medula, Yacoob Tessy & Ferida Tessy called on us also Antone & Johny ~ Light N.W. & rather cool night, clouds disappeared Our departure from here in future is going to be on Friday instead of Thursday as Mr. Bottomley told me today, I wish it could be done this time, so as to be able to see Alexander’s letter arriving on Thursday to see what he has written regarding this sad affair, But as we are to be transfered to the Mejidieh this time she will be out of Dock, we want to leave one day earlier Modte N.W. breeze, and fine cool night
