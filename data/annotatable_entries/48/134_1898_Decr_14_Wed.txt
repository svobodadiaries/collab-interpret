Pîèrre & Alexander wrote to me, & told him what I had done through the German Consul & requested him to write to Cardinal Richarz in Paris to assist & use his influence to get my son liberated from this bitch of a girl to whom he is in love, & that she is an illegitimate Belgian woman from the Streets he promised to write to him tomorrow, & also to Père Henri at Argeuil to come & see him & speak to Alexander
