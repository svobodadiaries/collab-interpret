 but Dr. Rosen was too busy & packing his Kit, he could not see me, I left my card, And I got a donkey and rode out to Gherrara to see my sister Emilia & Alice encamped there, I had to dismount before reaching the tents as the donkey was very bad & gave it to the Sakka Ismail & told him to sent me an other one at 2 P.M. I breakfasted with them & having waited till 3 P.M. without seeing the donkey coming, so I walked in, & met the donkey just inside the gardens so I did not required it any more
 I reached home at 4~ I went to the Raffooli of the Telegraph employé & he said that the line is broken still
 but I gave him the two telegrams & asked him to send [strikeout] them tomorrow or the day after as soon as the line is open because I want Alexander & Père Pièrre to get them in time as the Arabistan leaves Marseilles on the 30 Instt
