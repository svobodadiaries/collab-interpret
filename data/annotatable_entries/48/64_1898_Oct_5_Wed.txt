 I suppose I got so sorry & disgusted of these telegrams and always he is trying to stop his departure and make some excuses, I could not eat my breakfast at all
 ~ I left & went to Sister Medula to confer with her but I saw there Father Emmanuel the Carmelite & we came to the conclusion that as Père Pièrre must be now gone to Paris about today or tomorrow before starting for Baghdad, it would be a good chance to wire to him to go & see Alexander & try to bring him with him
 so I went with him to the Church & made out this telegram Père Pièrre Missionaire Couvent Carmes Pompe Passy Paris Prière Voir Alexandre 124 Rue Rennes rassurez Sur Santé, persuadèz Voyager ensemble absolument, disposè oublièr, repondèz Svoboda I also made out one for Alexander, thus Svoboda 124 Rue Rennes Paris Accompagnèz Pêre Pièrre actuellement Paris lui telegraphiam sujet, Mère Basreh ~ Svoboda I sent them at 1 P.M. at once and paid 23 ½ frcs
