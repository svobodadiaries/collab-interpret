Ely wind & clouds are gathering sign of bad weather coming
 At 8 ½ am I went to Sister Eliza’s house for the wedding of her daughter Regina, but feel so very unwell weak & very sad about Alexander’s doings, he is killing me, the tears always running down my eyes
 Many people came & at 9 ½ we all went to the house of Monsigneur Altmayer to his Chapel where he performed the ceremony short & simple and we then all left and went to the British Residency where Mayor Melville the Officiating Consul made out the Certificates of marriage and both husband & wife had to sign them, the husband M. Duncan Alexander having turned a Roman Catholic, we then went to my sister Eliza’s house and all the invited party were there they had Champagne & cakes
 there were about 50 persons, the Comets people Capt Cooper & the Chief & 2d  Engineer, Mr. & Mrs. Bottomly, Alfred Holland, Mr. Hall & wife, Dr. Zakhur, Selman Durion & wife, Grzesiki & sister Medula & many others, I came on board at 10 ½ sent money to the office
 and I then sent the following telegram to my wife Eliza in Basreh Sayegh " Basreh "Alexander not coming "tell mother prepare "return Svoboda "12/12/98 At 12 I went over to Sister Eliza & found all the people there making merry, the Jewish music or Brass band & the Tabul playing, they danced & did all sorts of amusements
 but the people were sorry to see me in this state of grief I was in, not even at the table could I keep myself from weaping, If it had not been for the sake of my sister Eliza who is our eldest sister I would not have gone
 At 4 P.M. I left them & came home
 Mr. Richarz came to me and I explained everything about Alexander & asked him to take that step & get him sent out by force through our ambassador in Paris, he concurred with me in the matter, and was just going to see M. Rouet & dîne with hîm and will also talk & consider the way for doing it, & if I call on hîm tomorrow to give him the address of Alexander & any other information on the matter
 ~ I called on Antone Marine for an hour & returned at 7 S. Ely wind & cloudy weather 1898 Decr
