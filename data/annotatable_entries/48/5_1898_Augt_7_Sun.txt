7th Sund Ther@4.84 1898 Augt 1898 Augt Modte N.W. & fine weather At 7 Â½ am Eliza & I went to Church, I called on Antone Marine & then came home found a lot of visitors & relatives there~ At 11 I went to see Dr. Rosen the German Consul and I told him that his telegram to the Ambassador had not been sent by Henry for reasons of the military service etc, he was astonished at it & said that he had already written a letter & sent by last post to the Ambassador in which he referred him to the telegram, & he was very sorry at my brother Henry why he did not tell him so, and he told that there is no fear of his being taken as soldier, while he is in France
 I asked him if he likes he can renew the telegram & I will send it, or if he think better to withdraw the letter & send to Beyrout a telegram by Mr. Juliette to send the letter back, he agreed to this, but I asked him if I speak with Mr. Rouet to ask him to wire to the Prefecture or Police at Paris to get Alexander sent out & he ordered to proceed to Marseilles & Baghdad as he is a minor yet & his father wants him here quick, he ignored the rules of the French Governt. & asked me to see Mr. Rouet & speak to him on the subject & tell him that he will call & speak about this matter with him at 5 P.M, I left & called on Mr. Rout & spoke about the matter, he tells me that the French Governt cannot cannot interfere in the matter without being asked first by the Austrian Ambassador & as for ordering him out of France, they cannot do so unless on some cause or crime then he can be expulsed
 but as for being taken as a solider this is impossible, no foreign subject can be taken from a foreign country, according to a Convention between the powers etc
 I left at noon & came home
 ~ I called on Sister Medula & then on Mr. Julietti and spoke to him about the letter of D. Rosen & he said it can be done if he writes to him & ask him to send it back from Beyrout
 I called on Alice & Sister Eliza & came home, Eliza & I are so sorry & have lost our head at this matter & we are so down hearted & grieved ~
