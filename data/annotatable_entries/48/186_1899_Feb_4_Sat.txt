4 Satur, Therm. @ 6.46 1899 Feby At 1,,30 AM. We passed the Ressafah & Barge going up at Temreh ~ At 4 I again went into my Cabin after a useless attempt to sleep
 We passed Ctesiphon at 3 and Diala at about 5 1/2~ I dosed off at about 5 for 1/2 hour & awoke shivering At 7 we went alongside the bank at the Bridge of Gherrarah & landed at Horse, I feel so very weak that I could not get out of my bed, at 7,,10 we went on ~ Fine clear & cold weather
 Light Erly breeze
 At 9,,30 landed the mails at the Residency, steamed up to the Custum House, no other steamers are here
 I went home found Eliza unwell in bed & Antone Marine her brother there
 She has had an attack of diarrhea & vomiting some 4 days ago at night and had the fever, but she is a little better
 I was too weak to speak & relate my sufferings to & sleeplessness
 so we are both convalescent
 I found the telegram from Chiha Tonietti from Constple arrived here on the 31st Jany they say, "Pera, 31/1/99 "Svoboda, Bagdad, "Suivant renseignements "Alexandre, probablement "Egypte~ Tonietti, Chiha, It has no meaning to my enquiry
 we cannot Know certain whether Alexander has really been to Constple or this only guess that he must be in Egypte
 Antone, Pere Emmanuel & others doubt it, & that he must again have been playing trick to get the money from Bazin
 found also a letter from Yousif Serpos with the Photo of himself wife & children, also a letter from Böhm, Vienna in which he mentions of our Emperor Francis Joseph’s 50 Years Reign’s Jubilee past off well & he has been presented with a decoration for both his military & Civil Service etc~ After breakfast I had a short nap but the palpitation of my heart & the sinkness of breath are troubling me much, The Ressafah arrived at about 6 P.M.~ Johny my nephew called in the evening
 S. Erly wind
