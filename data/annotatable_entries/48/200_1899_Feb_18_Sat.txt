 we were told that the President of the french Republic Mr. Felix Faure died suddenly from appoplexy, in Paris the night before, I went home saw Eliza, she is much grieved & unwell on account of Alexanders news
 I found a letter from him to his mother which was enclosed in Antoine Guilietti’s letter, it is dated the 19 Jany from Paris (so it showes that he has not left for Constple & that his telegram from this town of the 24th Jany was false) he complains awfully for his state of life & wanting money & begs to his mother to be allowed to marry the girl otherwise he will commit suicide & finish with this world & other stupid talks, which made me very vexed
 & the worse still is that I received a letter from P. Pièrre from Port Said of the 21 Jany telling me that Alexander wrote to him from Zurich in Switzerland to Marseilles asking him to advance him 250 frcs, & as soon as he receives it, he will leave for Constple & he sent it to him like a fool, and I was terribly angry
 he says that he has now advanced him in all 1,350 francs
