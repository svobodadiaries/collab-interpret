12 Friday Therm @ 4.72 Light n.w. breeze & quite cold, I felt it so cold in bed that I had to come down to my cabin At 4,,30 am got underway from Ledje but detained on a shoal till 5 when we proceeded ~ At 5,,50 anchored at Oweyn to sound, the S.S. Ressafah & Barge are aground here, she had left Baghdad the day before yesterday ~ before yesterday ~ The Pilot came to say that there are only 2 1/4 draas water in the Channel which is impossible for us to pass, We weighed at 7 & dropped further down
 sent a steersman to look for an empty boat to discharge cargo
 At 8 am the S.S. Comet came up & anchored down below, she has Major Melville the new Actg
 Consul General for Baghdad
 - We have over 83,000 Okes drawing 4 feet 2 Inches which is too much, & knowing very well the state of this place when we came up this time we were 4 hours aground ~ The Comets boat came up her for their mail, I gave a letter to his mail, I gave a letter to her officer to be taken up to my wife, told her to send all letters or telegrams with a Saka if she came down here by tomorrow
 I engaged an arab from the Beni Ajil tribe of Sheikh Dahy our Old friend they are encamped at Rahmanyeh & gave him a letter to my wife telling her to send me the letters of Alexander & all the news she has I finished with this Arab Alewy his hire for 5 Beshlics on condition that he is to be here tomorrow by this time & ferried across in the Ships boat to Oweyn at 10 1/4 am to take the road to Ledje & Ctesiphon, he promised to be here tomorrow morning
 I wrote two letters to be sent up with Henry & posted, dated the 18th Instt. one to Blockey & one to Rezkallah Korkis, told all about Alexander's foolish affair & what stupidity he has done, the are to be sent on, on thursday next the 10th ~ We have been discharging cargo ever since 8 am in our Launch & land it far down the river before the shoal, the Comet is doing nothing she has dropped down to the East bank of Dawer just to where I was encamped out shooting in 1885
 the Ressafah is also landing Cargo in her Launch near ours under the high bank of Dawer, the Kfefan Arabs are there, their Sheikh Selman el Abbass & his Arabs wanted to watch the Cargo & be paid but we refused them, & Capt Cowley asked the Engineer Mr. Banian (now in charge of the Comet Since her Captains death Lieut Beaumont in Baghdad 2 months ago) to drop the Comet further down opposite our Cargo which he did
 The Ressafah keeps heaving over she worked till midnight
 we stopped discharging cargo at sunset, Light n.w. & fine cool weather
