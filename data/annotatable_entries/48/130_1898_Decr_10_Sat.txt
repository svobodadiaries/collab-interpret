10 Satur Th@6.34 Decr [A48_263_05:080] 1898 Decr [A48_264_12:081] [A48_265_06:082] 1898 Decr Light N.W. & fine weather At 1 am passed Ctesiphon Detained at Gusseiba about ½ hour in touching shoals & backing~. At 4,,30 Diala river, met the Boat of the Mossul which had got adrift & they asked us to tow them up, we took her in tow and met the Mossul at Dedewyeh on her way up & cast her with her crew
 Passed the Bridge of Gherrarah at 5 ½ Light N.W. & cold weather At 8.10 landed the mails at the Residency & went to the Custom House, the SS. Phrat is here discharging I went home, my servant Meekha gave me a letter from Alexander dated the 11 Nover
 there is nothing decided in it, he only complains of Johnys letters to him in which he had given him all the advises & councils & told him that his complaints & illness are lies & humbugs, and Alexander insists that they are all true, & hopes if he leaves he will try & accompany Père Pierre & all these sorts of non= sence which made me so sorry
 as I got occupied in cleaning & arranging our big sitting room etc, with the servants, at about 9 am I received an other large registered letter brought by the Post man on its envelope was written in french & Arabic that on no account must this letter be delivered to any other person except into my proper hands, it is dated the 13thNovr from Alexander in answer to my long letter of the 12 Octor which I had sent from Basreh & kept a copy
 it is about 4 sheets a most fearful one he complains of himself and confesses of all that I have written to him to be true & that he has betrayed me, & he is mad & has lost his sense & so on and does not say a word about his leaving, I was so awfully struck down from sorrow & grief that I felt unable to walk or do anything I was trembling & weeping, my knees got shaky & powerless, I became miserable, while I was reading the letter, Père Emmanuel called on me, with a very sorrow face and gave me a card from Père Pierre from Paris dated the 7th Novr he writes to me & says that Scander came to bid him his last farewell & told him that he was going to leave by the Messagerie via Beyrout so as to be here by Christmas & before him, & so he requires 250 frcs for his expences to travel with and Pièrre gave it to him & obtained a receipt, and so the stupid Pièrre let him go & paid the money against my express order in the telegrams that he is only to pay him on condition that he must accompany him, he played Père Pierre also an other trick & got 450 frcs in all from him
 I was mad from sorrow and grief, I am sure now that Alexander is not with father Pièrre, and that he is & remains still in Paris and in his letter he tells me that he is mad & thretens to commit suicide and will never be able to see us any more
 ~ I passed a most miserable time in my house, Antone & Johny called on me they red the letters, and they were astonished at his writing & were very vexed for such a mis= behavior ~ The Mossul came up at about 11 am ~
