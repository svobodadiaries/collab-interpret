23 Tuesd Fearful weather
 the dew fell like rain , warm and disagreable, I have not seen for years
 I came to the Blosse & begun to get my cabin put to right by carpenters, & shifted my kit gradually, the heat is killing us, I never saw like it, the perspiration running down & clothes saturated with water I was so tyred being on foot all the day & nearly fainting from fatigue, till sunset when I had finished my shifting
 The heat is most awful dead calm & warm as a bath~ At 8 P.M. the Khalifah came down, [strikeout] We sent our boat for letters
 and I got mine from Eliza & one from Alexander from Paris dated the 29th Ulto
 also from Henry but I could not read them from the heat
 Later at night it became little cooler, I slept on upper deck of the Blosse Lynch, breeze from West
