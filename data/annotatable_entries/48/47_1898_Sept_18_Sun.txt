18 Sund Therm @ 72 Noon 90 [A48_110_13:031] At 2 Am we finished the repair of the wheel proceeded, At 4 passed Baghdadieh fort

 At 5,,15 I landed at Gherrarah & walked to town
 there are 7 Tents at Gherrarah of Christians encamped there, Selman Durion and others

 I met Dr. Rosen on horse back the German Consul he told me of the Assasination of the Empress of Austria Elizabeth, she was she was stabbed by an Anarchist at Geneva on Sunday last the 11th Instt
 just on celebration of the day of the Jubilee of her husband the Emperor Francis Joseph, I hold heard it at Basreh, on the night of our leaving from our 2nd mate who brought the mail up from the Amra
~ At 7 I arrived home went on top of the house, saw Eliza, she says that a telegram from Alexander came asking for money & also his letters by the two last mails, his telegram is as follows
 "Svoboda Baghdad "Embarassé indisposé "Korkis refuse payment "Autorisez Ottombanque
 It is dated the 11th Instt, and arrived the 14th
 Not only this is most disappointing telegram & enraging but the worst is that, the foolish thing is that Georgis Antone has brought to my wife a Receipt from Alexander dated London 20th Augt for 30 T Liras having received it from his agent at Constple according to the letter of recommendation I had obtained from Georgis to his agent Nazaret Kasberyan to pay him this sum on his arrival at Constple & not otherwise. I was so enraged at what this scamp is doing
 he is trying to get money from all ways & manners
~ The Mejidieh arrived at about 9. She was aground at Cherd el Pasha~
