 At 10,,10 I landed at Gherrara & walked in to Baghdad, I felt it very hot, as the S.Ely wind was behind me & the sun hot, I went straight to Lynch’s office got there by 11 ½ saw Mr. Bottomly for some business & also told him about the mistake I had made in last voyage up in the calculation of the Basreh passengers, I had only found it last night, after much searching & examining account as I had made the Balance of my cash Book on the way down this trip for the end of the year & found that I was 2400 G S. P. over & could not find it where it occurred, until I counted the passengers old ticket Book & found that I had omitted 40 passengers on the voyage up on 21 Decr, @ 60 P. each it just came to 2400, this 40 passengers were issued in the ticket Book which I had sent to the office after it was finished
 I told Mr. Bottomly that I will enter these 40 passengers in next voyage up so as to ignore every thing~ I left & came home, but so very tyred & giddy with very bad headache, the was had stirred my bile, & not having had breakfast, I saw Eliza, she said that no letters from Alexander had arrived for the last two weeks by Post
 but one letter from Père Pièrre from Tarascon dated the 14 Decr arrived on Saturday (the day before) which was sent by Père Marie Joseph, there is nothing decided in the letter about his or Alexanders departure, he only relates the way in which Alexander is humbuging me for drawing money, & he has already advanced him 750 frcs, & Alexander always promises hîm of leaving in such & such a date etc etc
 The Mejidieh arrived at about 0 ½ P.M. ~ The S.S. Mossul is here only she is loading & leaves tomorrow ~ I called on sister Medula at 2 P.M. also on the Carmelite fathers saw Père Emmanuel spoke about P. Pière etc, & came home
