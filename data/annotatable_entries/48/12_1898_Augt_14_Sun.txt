14 Sund Ther @ 5.78 [A48_045_04:008] [A48_058_17:009] [A48_058_18:010] Light n.w. & fine ~ The Comet got over the Shoal this morning
 the Khalifah is lightning herself on the bank at Dawar opposite us the Ressafah is still in her place down below us
 At 8.40 am. the Comet weighed & proceeded after having got all her stores from the bank
 I sent a letter to Eliza with Tom Dexter the second Engineer
 The S.S. Khalifah after having landed all the Hoop iron about 3500 bundles on the bank and her passengers too, she weighed & steamed on to the place where the Comet was aground soon after the latter had left, she took our anchors ahead & kept heaving on & moving up slowly
 Henry writes to me that he saw only one partridge this morning which he shot
 Henry crossed over to see me at 2 P.M. ~ the Khalifah hove over the shoal at 3 P.M. & steamed up, & at 3 1/2 we weighed and turned round & steamed down on to the shoal which has got better now & a little deeper, she struck the shoal & turned round broadside on and we took an anchor out ahead & turned up stream her bow & she got off & went into deep water & alongside the bank of Dawar where our cargo is lying, and we began to load, At about 6 1/2 P.M. our messenger arrived back from Baghdad with the answer of Capt Cowleys letter to Lynch & Co. they allow him to tranship cargo with the Khalifah & return if there is no chance of our getting over the Shoal
 a Sakka Ismaîl also came with the messenger he brings me a letter from Johny & Telegram from London the one in one of mine which was sent on the 11th. I had left with Jhony to be sent, it is dated the 12th Instt
 as follows. “ Svoboda Baghdad “ Conformant vos ordres. “ desiste opinion partirai “ Absolument avec Essayie “ tranquillisez “ Razkallah Alexandre I am so very glad to hear these news & hope my last telegram has served Alexander as a good lesson & brought his senses to him back
 But I am very sorry for What he has done in such a short time & has spoilt & upset everything as well as his intended programme of his return journey which I had so well arranged and planned for his benefit & Comfort, We worked in shipping the Cargo from the bank till 10 P.M. & finished this last portion of it & there remain the other lot on the bank further down
