 I sent the Servant early to look out for the Postman but could not be found, at 8 am. I Came on board
 sent money to the Office & went home at 10, called on Sister Medula on my way
 at 11 I Got the letter of Alexander the Postman brought it only one of last week, the letter of this week has not arrived on Thursday & is expected today
 this one is dated the 16 Septr. he Complains very bitterly of his indisposition being very ill with fever and diarrhea & also the pain on his side (which he mentioned in his telegram of the 4t Octer as Coté & we could not make out the meaning) he also complains of not having any money, & living very miserably
 R. Korkis would not advance him any money & so he is starving & unable to voyage because he is unwell & so on, I made out 2 Telegrams one for Père Pièrre & one for Alexander but the wire is not working for the last 4 days
 I took a cold bath at home Johny & Artin called on me
 Light N.W. & fine cool weather
 I slept in my room & was not warm
