 Henry came to me and we went to call on Monseigneur Altmayer to wish him good bye, he starts this evening for Mardin via Deir, in a Takhtarawan, also the Assyrian Bishop, for the election of a Patriarch, PÃ¨re Augustin is left here until the return of Altmayer here on about the 20th of November, I requested him that should my son Alexander (who leaves Paris today according to his telegram) wishes to go from Aleppo to Mardin to join and come back together to be so good as to look after him
 Johny & Artin came with us
 we passed to see Alice & Sister Emilia & I came on board at 8 ~ The SS Mossul droped inside to the wharf to discharge, she is ordered to go up river some where near Kadumain to meet the new Mushir Pasha coming by and having passed Ana 4 days ago & bring him down
 He was the Waly & Mushir at Yemen, is called
 Ahmed Feydi Pasha, At 11 went to breakfast, I found a telegram at home just arrived from Alexander from Paris dated the 5th, Svoboda Baghdad Cant go Constantinople Cause Passport
 This ungrateful son is giving me great trouble and behaving very badly, he simply is dodging with excuses & lies
 but he does not know his bad consequence & ruin, he will get no more money from me
 I went to see Henry & talked over this telegram they all consulted me to wire him to come out by sea, where there is no passport necessary I came on board at 2 P.M. we shipped some more cargo
 Having our 90,000 Okes
 At 6 P.M. I went home saw Henry there
 they wanted me to wire to Alexander to let him come by sea to Basreh, so that he can show no more excuses, but I wont do it, & it is better to let him remain unanswered & no more money will he receive so that he will feel it and until he begins to starve, Light n.w. & fine cool night ~ 1898 Septr
