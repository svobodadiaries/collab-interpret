 At 4,,10 touched the Shoal at Gusseiba, worked her back, with the Engine, she stuck again, while taking an anchor out ahead, she got off ~ At 5,,40 proceeded ~ At 7 passed Diala, detained 10 minutes in shoal water just in rounding the Diala river ~ At 8,,15 I landed at the Tents just above the Bridge where I met Polus Serkis & his wife & Mily his brother Naoom’s wife & her son Yacoob also Antone Marine his wife & children these latter are in the Garden of Gherrarah in the home of Nawab Ahmed Agha with Jeboory Asfar’s wife, Antone tells me that no telegram has yet arrived from Alexander
 I walked up to the Tents of Alice & Sister Emilia above the Garden of Gherrara about 600 yards they are by themselves only there with their servants and 2 watchmen Arabs
 I sat about ½ hour & left them & walked in to town at halfway I met some Sakka donkeys returning I rode one for 5 piaster to inside the Gate, arrived home at 9 ¾ ~ I found our servant Meekha & his wife Khokhy only here she is in bed having delivered a child 8 days ago in my house ~ The Mejidieh arrived at 10 ½ ~ I found two letters here from Alexander one of last week (arrived on 22 Sept and the other of this week) (arrived on the 29) but both letters were brought from the Post Office, Cut open, with a Knife from the edges. My servant says he received the latter one opened, and the former one of last week also was given to Johny open
 every one tells me that the Suspicion must fall on Antone Julietti who must be the author, having been Alexander’s friend and wishes to know all about his doings, & as his father is the Inspector of Post and Telegraph here, the Turkish employèes are, as is natural with to favor anything he wishes to do for the sake of his father
 I sent to enquire from Antoin Julietti he came at once to me expressing his utter ignorance of the affair, I told him that I shall have to complain of this matter to my Consul against whoever has done it ~ I called to see Menusha, I found her well only little weak from vomiting which she had few days ago
 I sent a telegram to Henry this afternoon to Basreh Svoboda Basreh Wife perfectly well little weak. Svoboda, I called on the family of Pahlawan opposite us
 breakfasted at home
