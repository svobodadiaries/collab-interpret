25 Sund. [A48_303_11:110] Christmas day, Light S. Erly breeze, & little cloudy~ At 2 AM /passed Ctesiphon At 4 passed Diala river
 At 7,,5 landed the mails at the Residency & went up to the Custum House, the SS. Ressafah only here she is loading ~ Very strong S. Erly wind blowing cold & swell in river, Eliza myself & the servant girl Mariam landed & went home, We soon put the sitting room to right for visitors ~ I found no letters at all from Alexander by the Damascus Post which arrived yesterday
 but I found the telegram which arrived here on Monday last the 19th, from Montpellier which is dated the 18 in answer to mine to Père Pièrre sent on friday the 16th, but as he was not there, it is as follows ~ "No 3940 16/12 Père Pièrre "Couvent Carmes Montpellier "parti faisons suivre par "poste~" We went to church & then I called on the Carmelite fathers, on the Assyrian Bishop the Chaldean Patriarch Abed Isho

 many Visitors called on us ~ in the afternoon I called on Menusha, Sister Medula Yagchies saw Louisa my niece & on Antone Marine, came home at 4, the Delagate Monseigneur Altmayer called on us
 At 5 Père Marie Joseph the Carmelite father sent for me to say that a telegram has just arrived & wishes to see me
 I went to the church and he showed me a telegram from Père Pierre from Tarascon dated the 22nd which has just arrîved it says " Carmes " Baghdad " Turquie "Bonne féte,donné "argent Alexandre parti: "Constantinople avertissez "Pièrre I told them that I cannot believe it. P. Pièrre is being sold by Alexander & he always promises to leave if he gets the money Besides this telegram P. Marie Joseph received last night a letter from P. Pièrre dated the 29 Ulto from Montpellier, in which he tells him that Alexander had written to him asking him for money that he was going to leave Paris on the 2d of Decr via Marseilles to catch the Baluchistan at Port Said if he can if not he will wa√Æt for the Turkistan, and P. Pi√®rre objected paying him until he sees him left
 ~ By this telegram he says that he has paid him, all this story I cannot believe
 Alexander, he is playing tricks with P. Pi√®rre to get money out of him I came home found Eliza nearly fainting from fright of probable sad news from Alexander However I calmed her down & explained everything
