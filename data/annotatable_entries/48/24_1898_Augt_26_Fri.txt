26 Frid 1898 Augt Modte N.W. & fine cool morning
 at 6 1/2 am I left Rufails place in his Bellem & came up to Maghil
 I found the Mejidieh will not leave before tomorrow morning for Basreh to load
 My cabin is very hot, I have not the ventillation but the air is cool outside
 Yousif Marine sent us a lot of melons & watermelons from his ground, they are very good
~ It became awfully calm & warm from 2 P.M. till late at night, the wind fell & became so very oppressive & muggy it made every body mad & did not know where to go, so dampy, & at sunset a thick fog came on from the north
 at about 8 P.M. the breeze sprung up and became cooler a little, I slept on board the Mejidieh on the upper deck, our crew & servants are shifting their Kit, & the cabin furniture~
