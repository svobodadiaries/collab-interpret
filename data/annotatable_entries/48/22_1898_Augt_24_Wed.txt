 I dressed took my bed & hired a Belem for 1 1/2 K. to Rufail's place & left at 6 am
 Took Rufail & Rezooki & we went to the Khalifah to see Henry, she is discharging & loading too & leaves this evening there are two mails for her to take up
 My wife has not sent me any clothes or anything, not knowing of our detention here
 I had to send some clothes to Tookyeh to be washed in Basreh
 I read Alexander's letter in the Belem as I was coming down from Maghil it is from Paris dated the 29 July, in which he divulges to me his intention of loving a young girl of 18 in Paris & asking permission to marry her, this intimacy & love had begun for the last 8 months a very long letter of 6 sheets ful of caresses & humility and the history of his intimacy with this girl being of a respectable family in France
 etc etc~ On arrival to Henry on board the Khalifah, I found he had just got a telegram for me from my wife she says " Svoboda Basreh, " Alexander wired " require money, wire Korkis " love. Eliza It is dated the 23 from Baghdad~ Henry tells me that Yousif son of Rafail Yaghchi has asked for the mariage with his daughter Louisa through the medium of Monseigneur Altmayer, but he has not yet given him an answer & wants to consider the matter & ask my opinion on it
 Yousif has been working for the last two months in trying to get married with the daughter of Naoom Serkis, but it seems that the mother Mily & the brother Yacoob have not consinted & so it is given up~ Weather is hot on board the Khalifah, although today there is a light air from N. West
 At 12 am I went up to Rufails place with Rezooki
 I wrote a letter to my wife & gave it to Henry, I made a telegram to Rezooki Korkis & sent it to Basreh at 2 P.M.

 At 4 1/2 P.M. we went onboard the Khalifah she was weighing her anchor, saw Henry for few minutes only & the Khalifah left at 5 P.M.~ We came back to the house
 Very light air from N.W. but the night was not so bad, but there are lots of sand flies~
