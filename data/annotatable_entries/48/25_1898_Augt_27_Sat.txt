27 Satur Money with Rufail Sayegh 1898 Augt At day break the Mejidieh & Blosse Lynch got steam up
 Mr. Reynolds our chief mate takes the Blosse to Basreh~ Modte N. Wester but my cabin is like a hot bath~ The Blosse Lynch left for Basreh at 6 am~ The Mejidieh also left at 6,,45 going easy up stream & turned round~ The found some defects in the pump of the Engines & we anchored abreast of Yousif's house to put it to right
 At 10,,10 Am we started for Basreh, after having put the Pump & Engine to right~ A fresh N.W. Wind blowing today
 but it is hazy with dust in the sky~ At 10,,40 We arrived and anchored at Basreh~ The S.S. Parran is up here loading~ The dust became thicker that we cannot see within 500 yards off~ It cleared off towards 3 P.M. We are shipping some cargo & will take in 30 Tons of coal at night~ Rufail came to me at 4 P.M. & I went up with him to his house
 I have lent him the money 1000 TLiras & paid it to him on Monday last the 22d Instt, for 3 years @ 7 1/2 % & he mortgaged his property the Mahowla where he is living by new Title deeds made in the Tapo in my name, I deducted the 75 Liras interest for next year & took two Bonds from him for the next two years payable at the expiration of each year
 In the evening Nessoory Andrea came he dined & slept with us
 The weather is very nice & cool, a Modte N.W. Wind prevails and the night is quite cool
