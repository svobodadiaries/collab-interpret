15 Tursd Therm @ 6.46 1898 Decr [A48_282_12:096] [A48_283_08:097] 1898 Decr Light S. Ely & fine weather no clouds to be seen at 8 1/2 am I came on board The Mossul & Barge went inside to discharge & we are loading over them The river is as low as before at 10 it began to get cloudy, at 11 1/2 went home to breakfast & sent my letters to the Post Office to Ibrahim Gejou including one for Alexander to R. Korkis London & to the news paper offices of the St Leclair in Paris for a subscription
 at 12 1/2 I came on board worked hard, we shipped a lot of Cargo but not heavy we took 81,000 Okes, At 5 P.M. I went home, Johny 	 & 	 Artin came, the Damascus mail arrived at 3 P.M.
 I had to send my servant to the Post Carrier for letters but he only brought me one letter from Schweiger Vienna, none from Alexander ~ Père Emmanuel called on me, with a letter from Père Pièrre dated the 21st Novr from Montpellièr he has not left yet & will not leave before the end of this month by the Turkistan Alexander has again played a trick to Pièrre & got from him 200 frcs more, Pièrre says that Alexander had sent him on the 7th a receipt for 50 Frcs which he was still in want of & Pièrre thinking that Alexander must have left Paris by that time as he had told him before so, he therefore annulled the receipt & wrote on the back of it to Alexander & sent it to the fathers here which they gave me just now
 But Pièrre says in his letter to the fathers that he was surprised when he received a letter from Alexander from Parîs, dated the 12th and asking him to advance him 200 frcs more, & Pièrre like a fool sent him the money, it is new already 650 frcs that Pièrre has given Alexander But ought to know well that my telegrams to him expressly say that he is only to advance him on condition that he should accompany him
 I am awfully vexed and sorrow at what Pere Pièrre has been doing and all my work with him proved fruitless, I therefore made out the following telegram to him to Montpellier, since he is still there
 ~ " Père Pièrre " Couvent Carmes " Montpellier " Dépéches Autorise "avancer argent Alexander "condition vous accompagne "déplore, encore Paris, "déployèz votre activité mêmes "necessaire Allèr Paris, "N'avancèz plus ~ "27 mots Svoboda 16/12/98 I gave it to Johny to be sent tomorrow morning
 & Light S. Ely & fine weather ~
