 In going round the reach of Deboony just below Sheresh the steamer went too close to the West. bank where this is a Mehayleh laden with grain & we squeezed her by the Ships stern carrying her side plank away with us, we let it go afloat & turned round at 7 and steamed up to the boat her crew were yelling & crying, we sent buckets & the pump & our crew with Mr. Reynolds and the Captain went, she was making water from the side where the plank was carried
 ~ I our men kept baling the Boat & landing the Barley on shore & trying to stop the leaking, but the boat is very old & rotten, they have filled the opening with cotton but still she leaks, they knocked off at midnight & we remained at anchor
