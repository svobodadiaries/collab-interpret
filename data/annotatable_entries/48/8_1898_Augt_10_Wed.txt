 1898 Aug 10 Wedn Ther @ 4.83 *must fiancér
  Modte N.W. & fine cool morning ~ at 7am I came on board
 D. Rosen has just sent me the letter of the Director of Post &Telegraph here advising him of the despatch of his telegram to Beyrout with reply paid, for the withdrawal of the letter he had sent to the German Ambassador in Paris regarding Alexander’s affair & it amounts to G. S. P. 43 ¼ which I paid the Kawass
 ~ I went home to breakfast at 11 found Sister Eliza there she stopped to breakfast with us, just at this moment I received this telegram " Svoboda " Baghdad "Après longue conversation "avec Alexandre ici Inevitable lui autorisèr financer venir Bagdad compagnie* Eassayie obtenir votre consentement repondèz ~ 9/8/98 Razkallah Alexander Eassayie
 I could not make out the meaning well & especially the word financer, perhaps it should be fiancèr, I went to Monségneur Altmayer & Père Augustin, they made it out that it should be fiancèr, that he wants me to authorize him to be betrothed, that it cannot be, because he is asking to come to Baghdad and obtain consent
 the telegram is so incomprehensible, I am determined to send a strong answer and a warning to Alexander and let understand that I will not do anything until he comes & if he persists it will be bad for him & for his future wellfare & let him take my last warning, I shall see this when I go home
 and unluckly we have a lot of cargo to ship, the ship is getting deep, & the cargo has been waiting since noon for shipment and the Captain has refused it until he came at 4 P.M. & allowed it to be taken, At 8 P.M.I went home found Anton Marine Johny & Artin my Nephews on the top of the house awaiting for me to see the telegram of London & what answer I am going to give, they red my answer & found it very good & a warning to Alexander for his selfish persistence, it is thus “ Razkallah London Cannot Sanction any- thing until Alexander's arrival company Eessayié if persists will be most disastrous for his future wellfare, let him take my advice wire departure 28 words Svoboda 11/8/98 Frcs 20,,15 I gave it to Johny to be sent on tomorrow morning ~ They left at 8 1/2 we had dinner at 9 ~ Light N.W. fine cool night ~ 1898 Augt
