 At 0,,10 Am. passed Gorna Light S. Erly & fine weather, At 4,,30 anchored at Azair Tomb
 one Jewess passenger came~ At 5,,30 proceeded
 at 6,,45 came to the Shoal of Ghumeijeh, could not pass, with 3 feet 9 Inches draft, took out an anchor ahead to heave over
 A thick fine fog is stretching on the horyzon from East to North being cleared off by the breeze of S. Easter~ They worked on taking anchors out and heaving ahead over the shoal until 1 P.M. When we got over & steamed for about 50 Yards & came to another shoal, where we found the Ressafah & Barge bound down having left the same day as we did, she is repairing her Rudder [strikeout] I think With her stern on the bank, the river being so very narrow here, We took out an anchor ahead to heave on, and kept taking ropes & pegs driven one after the other so as to keep aloof of the Ressafah the current being very strong & the Mejidieh is shearing from one bank to the other being afraid to go close to the Ressafah as she cannot resist the least shock being so old and rickety
 We at last got slowly up along the West bank & above the Ressafah by 4 P.M. & sent the Launch to bring up the anchor from the bank, The Ressafah also then cast off proceeded down, At 4,,45 P.M. we went on going easy
 The breeze having Shifted to a very light N. Wester, We had not gone 100 Yards when we got again in a Very strong current & the ship could not steer streight the helm could not act and the current driving her to the East bank
 we took an anchor aheat at 6 P.M. & hove up
 The weather is Very calm & warm, a great change in the atmosphere
 We knocked off work at 6 1/2 & remained for the night
 Very warm in the cabin & plenty Sandflies
