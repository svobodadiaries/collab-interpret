 I went downstairs & found the two letters one from Tom Blockey dated 4 May in answer to mine, he tells me that he hears that Alexander has gone to America with his girl & his son Edward arrived on the 19 of April from Baghdad via Bombay & Trieste
 The next letter I opened & found it from Rezooki Metchich from London, & enclosed in it an open letter sheet of few words written by Alexander from Chicago dated the 15 of April with his Card in it printed as Traveller Explorer, & reporter to many news papers and magazines, he writes on it as being a Member of the Geographical Society
 Rezooki Metchich Writes to me to say that he received this from Alexander to be sent to me but does not know his address as he is not fixed in one place
 Eliza & I went over to Sister Eliza, many people came there to see what to be done about Artin’s imprisonement
 Johny had spoken with Abduljebbar the Lawyer but this man seems not so inclined to defend Artin, there are many witnesses in favor of him
 and they were to go today to the Serai
 My Sister Eliza is very grieved & sorry at this matter
 I called on Mr. Richarz at 9 Am & asked him to write to the Austrian Consul General to remit my 300 frcs which I had sent him for Alexander for his expences to the Banker of Monseigneur Altmayer in Paris & gave him his name & address~ I then called on the Delegate Mons. Altmayer and told him that I had done so & requested him to write to his Banker to apply for the Money, I went to Lynch’s Office for business & for some £ Stg
 & returned to Sister Eliza, took my wife & came home~ At 4 P.M. called again on Sister Eliza
 Johny came from the Serai & says that they took the evidence of many persons they were all in favor of Artin, & also the Bishop came & as it got late to finish the evidence so it is left for tomorrow & so Artin will have to remain in prison tonight too etc etc
 I came home at 6 P.M.
