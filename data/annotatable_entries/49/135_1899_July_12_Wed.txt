 At 1,,30 P.M. the S.S. Phrat arrived from Basreh she made fast alongside the bank below where our Cargo is landed and Sent to sound, Today is a hot day with modte- hot breeze
 At 2,,45 the Phrat Steamed & passed up close along side of us there are now 3 & 3 1/2 draaz of Water
 It became very hot in the afternoon, the wind died away, the Cabin is like a furnace

 ~ At 8,,35 P.M. We Got underway & proceeded from Ledje~ Weather warm with light N.W. breeze At 12 P.M. we grounded at Semreh reach the current being very strong & narrow & the ship turned broad side on, Took out an anchor right ahead & remained for the night without heaving on, so see perhaps the current might shift her position, The S.S. Phrat is aground just ahead of us
