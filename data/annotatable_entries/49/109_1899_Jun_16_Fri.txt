 I have got a carpenter to make some reparation in the house ~ At 7 AM I came on board and went home at 8
 Artin my Nephew came to me & I went with him to call on Doctor Kazassyan whose only daughter Serpohy he has been engaged to, about a month ago, I saw her & her Mother, they are Armenians from Constple they have come here about four years ago, the father is a Doctor in the Turkish Army, I found the girl (1) intelligent, jolly, but not so handsome she is about 18 years old

 We then called on Hanosh Kroomy of Basreh and his wife are living here they have given up Basreh since last year ~ I called on Eliza & Adoola my cousins & coming home I met Ibrahim Gejou in the Street, I reproached him for not coming to see us before anybody else, he promised to come after breakfast, at 2 P.M. he came and We had a long talk with him about Alexander my son
 he assures me that he has not gone to America & that he is still in London, & he is only humbugging us, all his letters to us he says were not true what he wrote, he never was ill or had sore eyes & never went to Belfort and returned on account of his eyes
 the Girl had gone with him to Vienna & soon as he obtained from me the 90 £Stg he left Vienna & came to Paris & spent it very lavishly paying about 30 frcs a day for Carriage hire etc etc ~ At 5 P.M. I went to the Office to see Mr. Bottomley for some business & thence went to Sister Eliza where my wife came also & we returned home at 8 ½ Light N.W. & fine cool night
