6’ Mond Th@ 6. 42 1899 Mch [A49_019_16:015] Light N.W. & fine cold morning
 at 8 AM I came on board, the Mejidieh is inside since yesterday discharging The river is falling
 at 10 Am I went to see Mr. Richarz, also Dr. Hesse who showed me a letter from the Consul General of Beyrout dated the 6 Feby in which he says that the Consul General of Austria of Paris writes that after having searched for Alexander at No. 124 Rue de Rennes he was not there, & was informed that he was in the Hotel de Bon Marché No. 22 Rue Placide, there he was told that Alexander had left & probably gone to England so the money of 300 frcs is left with the Consul and wants to know what he is to do with it
 I asked Mr. Richarz to write again to let the money remain for the present until probably Alexander may wire for money & then I can refer him to the Austrian Consul to get it from him, so Mr. Richarz is going to do so, I left & came to the office for some Gold sovereigns to pay the Officers~ Sister Medula called also Eliza & Adoola my cousins~ The SS. Mossul arrived at 10 Am~ I took a hot bath~ Fine cold weather
