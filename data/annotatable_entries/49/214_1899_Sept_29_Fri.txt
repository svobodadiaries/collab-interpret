29’ Frid Septr. [A49_410_09:246] Light air & warm~ At 4 Am Eliza & the Watchman Muttar came with me to the steamer to land them at Gherrarah
 I asked Capt Cowley Yesterday to land them
 also to Allow the Khoory Toma Bahi to let him land with her as he wants to see the Assyrian Bishop Aghnatius off, as this latter is going to Calcutta for 6 month’s leave for business & the Khoory Toma is acting for him
 But this morning when Capt Cowley came on board he sent to say that he cannot take Khoory Toma to Gherrarah as Mr. Bottomley Objects to landing any people, I offered to pay the Coot passage, & even that he objected, so he went back on shore, I am awfully sorry, for it, as my wife had invited him to stay & breakfast with her
 I am so very sorry & disappointed at such a disgusting way of treatment~ Baghdad to Basreh [29 SEP 1899 --- V049_30_S] (//) with Barge (//) 1899 Septr PassengOkesG.
