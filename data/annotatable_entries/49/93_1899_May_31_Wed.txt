31 Wedn. 1899 June [A49_176_12:118] [A49_177_10:119] Light air & sultry
 at 7 Am I called on Menusha & then came on board Paid the Officers’ wages & Others
 At 9 I went to the prison in the Serai & saw Artin my nephew he is in a room upstairs with two or three other Mahomedans prisoners, Johny was there & says that it will be settled today & Artin will be let out
 I left at 10 & came home As I was taking a warm bath, Johny & Abduljebbar Effendi the Lawyer sent for me to come quick, as it requires my visit to Hamdi Beg the Mufettish Adlyeh to talk to him as he is my friend, and the matter will be settled so I hurried on, & Alexander Duncan the husband of Regina came with me to see Artin
 but on arriving to the Serai, they told me that it was finished and my visit to Ahmed Beg is not required, so they let Artin out on bail & Abduljebbar stood as security & gave a paper I saw the deposition given by the bitch of the servant Zekki, a most horrible way~ At 4 ½ P.M. Artin was let out & we all walked out to his house, poor Sister Eliza was rejoiced & weeping
~ This incident will cost Artin about 50 TLiras, for charges, presents and bribery etc etc
 I came home & then called on Antone Marine came at 6, Antone then called on us for ½ hour
 Light Air & warm
