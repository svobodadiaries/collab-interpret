SP. per Shami) the Hellawy & Khadrawi per big Kara of 40 Baskets & the Saîr at 120, it is the cheapest price that they have seen for many years as the the crop this year has been one of the most extraordinary abundant But now the price went down so low as 220 & even 210, & the Saîr too in proportion
