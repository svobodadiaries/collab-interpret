 I hear that Anis Pasha the dismissed Waly of Basreh who came up about 15 days ago, has gone to Hussein & Meshed and is still there
 and is disgraced, & will not be appointed Waly anywhere it must be on account of the massacre of the Armenians at Dyarbekir three years ago, where he was then the Waly & he took very important part in encouraging it, & the Powers must have pressed their influence on the Sultan to have him dismissed from his functions The Damascus Post Arrived at 4 P.M.
