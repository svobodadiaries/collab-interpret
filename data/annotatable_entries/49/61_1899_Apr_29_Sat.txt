29 Satur Therm @ 5.74 1899 April [A49_108_06:075] [A49_108_17:076] [A49_109_01:077] Antone Marine’s son Gabriel left on 27 for Beyrout ~ [A49_109_22:078] S. Erly breeze & hazy warm weather
 At 6,,35 AM. passed Ctesiphon~ River has fallen about one foot
 I paid the Ship’s Company their wages for this month as they wanted it very badly
 At 9.10 passed Diala river
 At 10.35 I landed at Gherrarah & walked in to town
 I felt the heat very excessive especially when I got between the Gardens where the S. Erly wind behind me ceased & got so calm I could not go on & had to sit on a Saky & washed & took a rest
 I then walked in to town, arrived at 12 ½ saw my wife she is well but, there is no news or letters from Alexander at all he does not write & we do not know where he is
~ we are in such an awful way about him, Rezooki Korkis has written to his brother saying that he has been searching for Alexander in London but, could not find him, he was told that he had gone to America
 Eliza asked Yousif Korkis to wire to Rezooki and inquire 5 days ago but he has not yet got the answer
~ We slept in the big room, it is very warm
