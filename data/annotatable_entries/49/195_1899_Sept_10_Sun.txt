 I found a letter from Edward Blockey from London dated the 19 Augst he tells me that he went twice to see Rezooki Metchich but could not see him, & his landlord told him that Alexander had come to Rezooki about 3 weeks ago on a Sunday, So it appears that Alexander has not gone to America, Light N.
