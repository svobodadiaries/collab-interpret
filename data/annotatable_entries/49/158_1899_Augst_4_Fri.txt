4 Frid Therm@ 4.84 [A49_301_01:187] 1899 Augst Light N.W. & clouds again came on on the East, At 4,,30 am passed Gorna ~ We have altogether only 35 passengers ( one in 1st Class Meneshi Mathalon a Jew & is messing at the table with us, & one are 2d Class, Rezooki son of Yousif Naman a clerk at Berk Puttman), Very light N.W. breeze and getting very hot, At 9,,50 took the 2 Return Jews from Azair for Coot & went on at 9,,55, up till 3 P.M. we arrived to the Elbow, 5 hours from Azair we have been going very slow, although the Engines going full power but the speed is slow on account of the narrow= ness of the river and both Steamer & Barge are sucking in the water, Detained 45 minutes in going round the Elbow
 It took us from 4 to 6 P.M. to get to Aboo Roba, going slow & the river being so narrow for both Steamer & Barge
 The heat is most intense, no air at all & so warm, the perspiration running down profiously  ~ At 7 P.M. we anchored just above Aboo Roba Tomb
 Very Calm and as warm as a hot bath
 I found myself up till midnight when it became a little dryier ~
