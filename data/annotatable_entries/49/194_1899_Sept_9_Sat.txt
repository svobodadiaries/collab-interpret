 At 10,,15 Grounded at Brenij above Humenyeh took out an anchor & hove off, at 11 we got off, but on going on, the arms of the starboard wheel broke & had to come to for repairs, I made up my mind to land here & walk across to Abdulla to shoot
 there is a fresh wind but the sun is still hot
~ At 1 1/2 P.M. I dressed & took the Deckman Shansoka & went out
 walked across the desert to the bank & mound below Abdulla reach & walked up the bank, no partridges are to be seen, the Cover is good, but it looks desolate & dry
 lots of pigs started about 15 from beneath the cover
 I went twice to the bank to have a drink the wind blowing strong & hot
 we put up about 6 or 7 partridges at a distance & I shot only one which put up before me, after I had got far up the reach, flashed 3 or 4 hares at a distance & by 5 P.M. I had to come to the bank & sit down to await for the Mejidieh near the place used to be called Cherd Dowd el Farman, I was very tyred & been so very disgusted in not finding any partridges
 Besides I could not walk any more, having got the pain on my right Knee, a muscle or the bone commenced to ache fearfully so that I could not possibly walk or move on, the Weather became Cooler as the sun went down, & I saw the smoke of the Mejidieh at Raddat coming up At 6,,15 I embarked & we went on
 The Mejidieh had left Brenij at 2,,10 P.M~ At 4 she stopped at Azizieh & the Boat went on shore with Abdul Kadur Khdery he expected a telegram from Baghdad about his father's health, but as he had received none, so he landed to go overland to Baghdad~ Abdulrezack Khdery his father must have died before this
 Tom Dexter the 2nd Engineer of the Comet was at Azizieh he has been sent down to explore the best shooting grounds by Major Melville the British Consul as he is coming down in the Comet & wants to shoot on his way down Very light N.W. breeze and fine weather
 At 8,,20 PM we grounded below the Dijleh's wreck, took an anchor out & hove off, at 10,,45 proceeded easy~ At 11,,15 P.M. passed Baghdadieh Fort
 Light N.W. breeze & fine weather, I slept in the Cabin
 my feet are sore & feel very tyred, I see that I cannot walk so much as I used to do a few years ago, especially this pain in my right Knee
