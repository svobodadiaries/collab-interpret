11 Tuesd Th @ 4,,75 1899 July Light N.W. breeze and fine cool weather~ The Khalifah left at about 4 am after shipping her Cargo~ We sent to Sound the Channel & found it getting better & deeper, the strong current running down between the two sand banks is carrying away the sand
 we took in few packages from the bank
 At 6 ¼ we steamed up toward the Shoal after having marked it
 We worked over with the Engines & got over the Shoal at 7 ¼ am~ Wind increasing and blowing fresh
 At 2,,20 P.M. the S Baghdad and Barge came down and anchored up, she sent to sound & at 4,,15 she came & passed through the Channel without sticking over 3 draaz, it is getting better now, An empty boat came down & we wanted her to bring us the cargo from the Other ride, they 60 Beshlics for two trips, and when we greed to pay them that sum they changed mind and asked 80 & then went away by sunset we had & only got on board about 450 packages out of 1112 landed
 our men kept bringing the Cargo in the Launch all the night, it takes about 2 hours to bring one boat load,
