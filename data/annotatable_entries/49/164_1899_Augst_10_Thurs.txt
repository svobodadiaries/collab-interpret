10’ Thursd 1899 Augst [A49_314_11:191] Light N.W. fine, at sunrise while still in bed, the Post man came & brought me two letters, one from the Schweiger Vienna and the other from Rezooki Metchich London enclosed a letter from Alexander from New York dated the 6 of July written to me & to his mother, he has received my letter of the 8 of June sent though Rezooki Metchich, he is well & assuring us of soon coming to see us etc etc
 I came on board at 8 AM sent money to the office & went on shore at 9 ½ called on Menusha & then came home found Sister Medula there
 I have had an awful pain on my spine I have been strained while washing so bad it is that I cannot walk but with great difficulty have used every thing, & all the friction to no use
 at 3 P.M. I came on board, we are shipping cargo, I wrote a short letter to my son Alexander just told him about the receipt of his letter & to hasten to come back quick as we are both ill & wish to see him etc, I also wrote a short letter to Rezooki Metchich & enclosed Alexander's letter in it to be sent to New York to him & sent it by today's post of Damascus
 At 5 P.M. I went home but could hardly walk from the pain on the spine, I laid up & need other frictions as Apodeldoe etc. but the pain is as bad as ever Johny & Artin my nephews called on us till 8 P.M. I feel relieved from the pain while I am lying down, & so I could sleep well
