 Our Fireman Shabo ibn Franso while he was working in the starboard wheel fell in the river & struggled & cryed until he got to opposite my cabin under the sponsoon and sunk & disappeared not knowing how to swim & the Barge being close alongside the steamer so no help could be rendered immediately expecting him to drift down to the ship's stern but he got drowned the whole crew were gathered to his rescue but they failed
 he was an old servant in the service for about 15 years ~ We have a lot of passengers coming mostly Arabs of Hassa & the river here & from Basreh going to the pilgrimage of the Moharrem festival next Lunar month
