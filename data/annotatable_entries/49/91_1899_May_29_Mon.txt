 At 6,, passed Diala river, At 7,,20 passed through the Bridge of Gherrara, At 10,,15 P.M landed the mails at the Residency & went up to the Custum House the S.S. Baghdad is here arrived today at noon~ I went home, saw Eliza she related to me a very sad news which befell to Artin my nephew after his betrothal~ They had a servant [strikethrough] Tilkefly girl about 16 years old called Zekky employed at Johny to look after his little daughter & having left the service about 2 months ago
 she has brought a complaint a few days ago against Artin for having violated her on promising that he will marry her and so she gave herself to him, & she aborted some time ago, now she claims him as her husband and being instigated by other women of bad repute to insist on & claim her right through the Turkish Government
 and so she went to the Serai accompanied by a woman called Eliza bint Abdulmadi a bad woman, & there she cryed out & in the most courageous manner & face she complained of Artin having outraged her etc
 and so Artin was sent for and put in prison without being questioned or tryed, a thing against the rule Abduljebbar the Lawyer tryed very much to let him out until his case will be investigated, but they wont allow it
 I have not learnt the affair yet how it occurred , as Eliza cannot understand it herself yet
 I could not sleep at all till the morning from the sorrow on account of Artin
