19 Satur Th@ 5.50 Raining. Light S. Erly breeze & cloudy gloomy all over
 Today is a Holyday of St Joseph, I came on board at 8 am, wrote out my letters, sent money to the Office and at 10Â½ went home, People are coming still to wish me a good Holyday
~ I took a warm bath in the afternoon, & people continue to visit us, I am so enraged at this beastly custum they have in Baghdad, they are so fond of visiting houses as if it was a special duty they must do
 Weather is changing for the worse S. Erly wind & cloudy, During the night it rained a little, and blew strong~
