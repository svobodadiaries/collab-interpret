 There is great scarcity and dearnes of provision in town, which is worth noting, it is caused by the scarcity of rain & the severe cold of this winter which killed all the vegetation & pasturage for sheep & cattle & the price rose steadily, although there are great quantity of Grain stowed away by the dealers in hopes of getting the price up & therefore making a good profit, the Government do not seem to take any steps to avoid this, & force the people & the sellers to dispose of the provision at a reasonable price, every kind of food rose accordingly, The actual price of provision & Grain are now selling as follows: Wheat the Wezna 78 Constple- Oke ______R.P. 500- Barley D D -"- 240- fresh mutton the Oke 20- Ghee, 20 Okes (1 mound) " 700- Eggs each 3 for -"- 2- Fowels from 20 to " 30- Patatoes the Oke -"- 8- Fish very scarce & double the price
