 With thick dust & rain & the strong lightning, the Wind is blowing from the opposite side & played havoc with the upper deck riggings, all the awnings Were torn away, stretchers broke & stancheons bent & were rattling on the deck like so many sounds of cannons, the passengers Kit flew on shore & most of it were picked away by Arabs
 the passengers came down yelling & crying
 the thick dust blinded us, the incessant lightning & thunder was a sight like a hurricane at sea, it lasted from 7 1/2 till 8 P.M. & kept cloudy with thunder & Lightning but the Wind fell a little~ The rain & dust made an awful mess on board, it penetrated into the cabins & some part of the decks leaking~ We then took in 6 Tons of coal & about 150 Tins of ghee & finished at 10 & hauled out & remained, it being cloudy~
