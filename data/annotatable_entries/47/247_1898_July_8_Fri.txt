8 Frid 1898 July [A47_339_05:210] The Mushir Pasha's destitution
 leaving Baghdad on the 17th Instant 1898 July 1898 July At 1,,30 Am we landed the mails at the Residency & went up to the Custum House, The S.S. Phrat is alongside here
 I went home at 3 Am went on top of the house saw Eliza & sat talking with her about Alexander, there are two letters here arrived one on the day of my leaving this last Thursday dated the 10 June & the second one arrived yesterday dated the 7th
 I red them all
 he has sent me his Turkish Passport (Murur Teskereh) asking me to get him a new one for this year to come on with it, because he says that BÃ¶hm told him he cannot get him an Austrian Passport as the Authority will then know that he is in Vienna, and in Septr there will take place the Conscription for the Soldiers, & he will be asked to serve his time in the military so he must leave Vienna by the end of August to come to Constantinople I received a letter from Blockey from Cheshnut the same place he is living in~ I took a Cold bath~ At 3 P.M. I called on Antone Marine in the Residency
~ I hear that the Mushire Rejeb Pasha is to be shifted from here to Tripoli in Algeria by an Order from Constantple it is to the regret of every body here Christians, Mahomedans & Jews because he is one of the best man in the Turkish service, a very honest streight forward man, a just and wise administrator, he belongs to the New School & a liberal & open hearted
 The present Waly here Atta- Allah Pasha who is a very Old Man, Very fanatic & lazy, & does no good to the Welfare of the people and the Country, hated by every body, but a has a great influence & being a relative of the Sheikh ul Islam and hates the Mushir in his internal feelings, being jealous of him because every body likes the latter, has been undermining him and, the Sultan hates every person in his service who has such influence & liberality with the nation
& frightened by false rumour being represented to him, that if the Mushire is allowed to be left in Baghdad where his popularity is gaining ground, he might eventually gain his independence by having all the Army Corps siding with him as well as the population, and it might end by the dismemberment of Irak Arabia from the Turkish Dominion, The population here had telegraphed to Constple in begging & praying the Porte to let him remain here as he has done no end of good to the country
 but this step it appears has made things worse, and the Mushire even did not like it at all, for this act will confirm the Waly's report against him
 The Mushir of Yemen also has been changed & is appointed here to replace Rejeb Pasha, other Mushir's have been also changed for equal reasons, The Sultan gets so alarmed now at the slightest news he hears, though untrue and false, at any person in Authority taking a liberal view in advancing Civilization in his dominion
 I called on Sister Eliza where Emilia & Alice also were & came home at 5 1/2, found Antone Marine there~ Light N.W. & fine but not so cool & refreshing
 Yesterday being my Son Alexander's birthday born on the 7 July 1878 so he has just finished his 20 years I sent him today before noon this telegram
 "Svoboda Handelsmuseum Berggasse Vienna Happy Birthday love Svoboda" I would have sent it before only I was on the way from Basreh~
