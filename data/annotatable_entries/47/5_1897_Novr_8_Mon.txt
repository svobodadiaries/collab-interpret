8 Mond The @ 6.60 Eliza’s arrival from Paris [A47_009_19:002] 1897 Novr [A47_010_09:003] [A47_011_17:004] Light n.w. & fine~ At 5,,45 am. we proceeded~ We took 17 passengers from Amara, At 9,,5 passed Azair, they have pulled down the Green Dome to rebuild it new
 At 0,,5 p.m.. stopped at Gorna landed 3 passengers and 20 packages, at 9,,20 p.m. left Gorna~ At 5 P.M. passed the SS Baghdad & Barge going up just Opposite Rufail’s house & I saw my wife Eliza standing on the bank with Rufail Tukyeh etc
 We anchored at Basreh the SS. Arabistan, Mobile & Dwina are here & also the Rusafah & Mosul
 I went up to  Rufail’s  place, & met Eliza there, I could not keep myself from the tears on seeing her without my son Alexander, but got very sorry on hearing from her the bad account she gives me, and behaviour of Ibrahim Gejou, who has not yet furnished his rooms & they use Alexander’s room, he has got not servant cook & feeding Alexander outside @ 3 frcs per day, he has got a wife for the second time since a year & half & goes often to her
 he wanted to force Eliza to pay him 150 frcs per month to keep her in the same room as that of Alexander & feed her in fact she says he is a lyar & a swindle & space has nothing at all & wants to make money out of us
 and she says that Alexander must not remain in Paris but he should return soon, because he will be spoilt & he expends more money than what I have allowed him (200 frcs per month) he is selling his postage stamps & expending
 she made me so very sorry & broken hearted that I lost all the pleasure of talking with her about anything else
 She has apparently expended the 1010 frcs I had given her at Marsilles and I shall have to pay her passage now to Jeboory Asfar of 31 1/2 £ Sterling. She has bought some clothes and perfumery etc for sale she drew 40 £ Stg from Rezooki Korkis to be paid here by her to his brother, she says they had fine weather on the way out from Marseilles except for two days it was bad after leaving Marseilles, & in the Red Sea it was very calm & awfully hot
 she landed in Bushire for few hours With Andrews Dinha the Engineer of the Persepolis~
