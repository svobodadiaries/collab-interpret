23 Wedn. [A47_185_11:122] 1898 Mch S. Erly breeze & cloudy weather, At 7½ am I called on Antone Marine and at 8½ I came on board, found the river had risen very high
 it rose 3 feet since last night, there is about 5 bricks more to reach its proper high rise for irrigation in this part around Baghdad
 This was the highest it had Attained last year & people could not irrigate their cultivation, The bridge is cut open since yesterday evening, The S.S. Ressafah and Barge left at 6 am
 At 11 I went to breakfast & came back at 12~ River keeps rising~ I closed Alexander's letter for tomorrow's Post and dated it tomorrow, also a letter for Mr. J. Böhm & one for Nessoory Sayegh & I sent them to the Post Office~ The river is at a Standstill since noon
 Our second Mate Mr. Hatfield has received a letter from the Agent of S Lynch & co (Mr. Bottomly) in which they complain in a very strong term of his bad behaviour on board with regard to an Accus- ation by a Jewess prostitude made against him in the Office, and also his neglect once in delivering the mail at Basreh in Augt, & was given to the Khalifah on her way down, also in leaving the steamer once when she was on the point of starting from Baghdad without asking her Commander and remained behind on pretence of his being ill etc, and therefore he is discharged from the Company's Service this time on our arrival at Basreh and is to proceed down to Kurachi being the first English Port~ Mr. Hatfield has decidedly carried this neglect of duty and the frequent visits of bad women into his cabin to excess, Otherwise he is sober and of good & mild temper, he certainly has followed what other officers are doing in both steamers~ At 6 p.m. I went home, S. Erly breeze but fine weather
