 I suffered very much from the pain of my stomach last night~ At 8 1/2 AM I called on Sister Medula & then came on board, the Mossul is still alongside the Custum House~ I sent the following telegram to Alexander at 10 AM "Svoboda 22 Rue Duroc Paris Suspendèz, preparèz depart Vienne Avril~" As I could not make out the meaning of the word in his Telegram of the 1st Instt Grammaire, (it may be the Arabic manuscript he calls it Grammaire, so I said Suspend as I will not part of it for 100 frcs
 I went home & wrote more in Alexander's letter
 called on Menusha Henry's wife & came at 12 Oclock~ At 2 1/2 P.M. I went to call on Coll. Lock the English Consul General
 he enquired from me all the old history of my father's affair here in 1820 when Mr. Rich the English Consul had the dispute with Dowd Pasha on account of my father' goods & he red to me the report in a book published by the Indian Government of all the events he asked me if I would come one day & have dinner with them
 I left at 3 1/2 & came home, took Eliza & went to Sister Eliza & spent the evening, there were Emilia, Alice, Menusha, Louisa, Michail & Yousif Yaghchi etc & we left at 8 P.M~ Light N.W. & fine weather,
